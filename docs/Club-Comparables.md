## Mercer Island Beach Club — Mercer Island, WA
EIN: 91-0606658 | 501(c)(7) | Most geographically comparable (Pacific Northwest, waterfront)

| Year | Revenue | Expenses | Salaries | GM Pay | Net |
|------|---------|----------|----------|--------|-----|
| 2024 | $3,231K | $2,737K | $924K | $174K | +$494K |
| 2023 | $2,886K | $2,795K | $806K | $158K | +$91K |
| 2022 | $2,812K | $2,402K | $695K | $142K | +$410K |
| 2021 | $2,670K | $2,175K | $683K | $120K | +$494K |
| 2020 | $2,310K | $1,844K | $585K | $114K | +$466K |
| 2019 | $2,200K | $1,931K | $497K | $105K | +$269K |
| 2018 | $1,860K | $1,848K | $507K | $102K | +$12K |
| 2017 | $1,651K | $1,779K | $443K | — | -$128K |

**Observations:**
- Salaries = 25–34% of total expenses consistently
- Club ran at a loss or near break-even from 2013–2018; only became reliably profitable post-2019
- GM alone costs $100K–$175K; total staff typically adds another $500–800K on top
- Initiation fees swing wildly ($0–$520K/yr) — unreliable as steady income

## Seabright Beach Club — Sea Bright, NJ
EIN: 21-0559020 | 501(c)(7) | Beach club with active F&B (bar/snack operations)

| Year | Revenue | Expenses | Salaries (total) | F&B Revenue | Net |
|------|---------|----------|-----------------|-------------|-----|
| 2024 | $3,349K | $2,917K | $1,411K | $1,050K | +$432K |
| 2023 | $3,057K | $2,836K | $1,322K | $989K | +$222K |
| 2022 | $2,712K | $2,527K | $1,217K | $878K | +$186K |
| 2021 | $2,364K | $2,261K | $1,104K | $795K | +$103K |
| 2020 | $2,312K | $2,252K | $1,031K | $521K | +$60K |
| 2019 | $2,163K | $2,171K | $983K | $702K | -$8K |
| 2018 | $2,081K | $2,145K | $934K | $692K | -$64K |

**Observations:**
- F&B is ~31–33% of total revenue but requires ~48% of total staff cost to operate
- Total salaries run $1M–$1.4M on $2M–$3.4M revenue — this is a fully staffed operation
- Even with F&B, net margins are thin: 1–13% in good years, negative in bad years
- This club has essentially no debt (liabilities <$35K) — margins would be worse with acquisition debt

## Key Takeaways for The Reef Model

1. **Salaries are the dominant cost**, not utilities or insurance. Budget 25–35% of total revenue for staff minimum.
2. **F&B revenue is real but requires real staff.** Seabright generates $1M F&B on $1.4M in total salaries. It is not found money.
3. **Net surpluses of $100K–$500K** are what healthy, established clubs actually produce — not $800K.
4. **Break-even is the normal operating condition** for the first several years of any club.
5. **The Reef is smaller than both comparables.** Its maximum realistic revenue is probably $600K–$1.2M, not $1.375M+.
6. **Initiation fees should not fund operations** — they are highly variable and will distort Year 1 vs. steady-state.
