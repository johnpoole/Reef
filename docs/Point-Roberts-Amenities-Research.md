## Point Roberts Marina Resort

**Overview:**

- ✅ Members can moor boats at marina and walk/drive to club (or arrive by boat)
- ✅ Validates "waterfront lifestyle" positioning even without on-site dock
- ✅ Complements beach access with marine recreation options

**Marketing Implications:**

## Recommendations for Beach Club Positioning

### 1. Emphasize Point Roberts as a Destination
**Message:** "Point Roberts offers the complete coastal lifestyle - private beach, premium marina, golf, natural beauty, and now, an exclusive members-only Beach Club."

### 2. Target Marina Members
**Action:** 
- Obtain slip holder list from Point Roberts Marina (if available)
- Direct mail campaign to boat owners
- "After a day on the water, return to your private Beach Club for sunset cocktails and dinner"

### 3. Explore Golf Course Partnership
**Action:**
- Meet with Point Roberts Golf & Country Club management
- Propose reciprocal membership benefits
- Test "Platinum Package" offering (Beach Club + Golf membership bundle)
- Joint marketing to Vancouver affluent market

### 4. Leverage Natural Assets
**Message:**
- "Where else can you watch orcas breach, eagles soar, and Mount Baker glow at sunset - all from your private beach club?"
- Emphasize rare combination: private beach + protected waters + wildlife + mountain views

### 5. Update Marketing Materials
**Revisions Needed:**
- Add "Adjacent to Point Roberts Marina Resort (one of the Pacific Northwest's finest marinas)"
- Include "Complementary to Point Roberts Golf & Country Club"
- Add photos of orcas, eagles, sunsets, Mount Baker views
- Emphasize "comprehensive coastal destination" rather than single-facility club

### 6. Validate Member Demand
**Focus Group Questions:**
- How many prospective members already own boats?
- How many are golfers?
- Would bundled membership (Beach + Golf) be attractive?
- Is proximity to marina important? (yes/no/somewhat)

## Financial Modeling Implications

**Revenue Opportunities:**
1. **Marina Partnership Revenue**
   - Referral fees from marina for new slip holders
   - Commission on boat services/supplies
   - Estimated: $5K-15K annually (low priority)

2. **Golf Partnership Revenue**
   - Bundled membership premium (Beach + Golf = $50K initiation vs $35K standalone)
   - Revenue share with golf club
   - Estimated: 20-30% of members might purchase bundle = $300K-450K additional initiation revenue

**Cost Implications:**
- Lower investment needed (no dock/marina construction required)
- Saves $500K-1M+ in marine infrastructure
- Can redirect capital to beach amenities, guest rooms, event pavilion

**Positioning Implications:**
- "Beach & Lifestyle Club" vs "Beach & Yacht Club"
- Emphasis on destination package (beach + marina + golf nearby)
- Less marine-specific, more comprehensive luxury lifestyle
