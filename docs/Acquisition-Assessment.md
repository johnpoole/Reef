## 1. Penclave Assessment

### Context

Point Roberts is a pene-exclave of the US, accessible by land only through Delta, BC, Canada. The only road crossing is Boundary Bay / Point Roberts Border Station (56th Street → Tyee Drive). Every person and every supply that enters or leaves by land crosses this border.

**Key facts established:**
- **[V]** Year-round population: 1,191 (2020 US Census)
- **[V]** Summer peak population: ~4,500 — overwhelmingly vacationing Canadians
- **[V]** Housing units: 2,068 total, 678 (33%) occupied year-round; ~1,390 vacant/seasonal, predominately Canadian-owned
- **[V]** ~40× more Canadians have mailboxes in Point Roberts than the number of residents (source: Vancouver Province, cited in Wikipedia) — implies ~48,000 Canadians with mailboxes, indicating very high routine Canadian engagement with Point Roberts
- **[V]** Delta BC neighboring population: 108,455 (2021) — Tsawwassen (directly adjacent) 20,933; Ladner 21,112; North Delta 51,623
- **[V]** Border crossing — Boundary Bay: confirmed as the sole land crossing for Point Roberts. CBSA tracking shows it in regular reporting.

---

### Q: Local labor pool — what roles can realistically be filled from Point Roberts residents?

**[V]** Year-round resident population: 1,191. Median age: 52.7 years (2010 census). The community skews significantly older; not a young worker population.

**[E]** Working-age adults in Point Roberts: estimate ~600-700, based on the 16.2% under-20 and 23.9% over-65 age distribution from 2010 data leaving roughly 59.9% between 20 and 64, applied to 1,191 = ~713 working-age adults.

**[E]** Of those, most are likely retirees who chose the location for retirement reasons, not workers. A realistic local labor pool (people willing to work in hospitality/service) is probably well under 100 active candidates.

**Assessment:** Local labor can credibly supply 0-1 roles consistently — perhaps a part-time front desk or events coordinator who lives there permanently. Every operational role (GM, line cook, bartender, FOH) must either be filled by a cross-border commuter or by someone who relocates to Point Roberts. Relocation is unlikely at entry hospitality wages for a 1,191-person town with limited housing stock.

**Open item: OI-04 intersects here** — housing availability for any staff who might want to live on-site.

---

### Q: Cross-border labor — true all-in cost vs. local hire, including NEXUS, wait time, reliability premium

**[V]** Workers commuting from Delta/Tsawwassen must cross the Boundary Bay border daily (or per shift). They need NEXUS or face standard CBP/CBSA processing, which adds unpredictable delay.

**[V]** CBSA border wait at Boundary Bay: "No Delay" on a typical winter weekday morning (Feb 21, 2026, 04:15 PST — confirmed real-time CBSA data). This is the off-season baseline.

**[G]** Peak summer wait times at Boundary Bay: **GUESSED at 30–90 minutes each direction on summer weekends.** This is based on: (a) Boundary Bay is a low-volume crossing relative to Pacific Highway (Surrey/Blaine) but all Point Roberts land traffic uses it; (b) summer population swells 4×; (c) Canadian cottage owners and day trip visitors create concentrated weekend demand; (d) Pacific Highway runs 10+ min per direction in shoulder season. *(→ OI-05: needs CBSA historical peak data)*

**[E]** Practical implication of a 60-min summer wait: A shift worker crossing each way adds ~2 hrs of dead time per day. At a $22/hr Canadian wage (Delta minimum wage area), that's $44/day uncompensated time, plus gas (~$10 round trip), plus NEXUS renewal (~$65 CAD/5 years). The employer does not pay wait time, but the worker incurs it — which directly limits the candidate pool. Workers who have alternatives will not take a job with a 2-hour daily border tax.

**[E]** Premium for cross-border hire vs. mainland equivalent: **ESTIMATED +25–40% effective labor cost premium**, accounting for: reduced candidate pool → higher wages needed to attract; higher turnover; scheduling uncertainty (any day a worker is denied entry or delayed misses a shift). This cannot be assumed to equal mainland comparables.

---

### Q: Canadian worker authorization — applicable visa category and compliance cost

*(→ OI-09: Immigration attorney needed. What follows is research-level context, not legal advice.)*

**[E]** A Canadian national working at a US business in Point Roberts requires US work authorization. Options:
- **TN Visa** (USMCA/NAFTA professional categories): applies to specific professional occupations (e.g., accountant, engineer, certain management roles). A GM might qualify under "Management Consultant" if positioned correctly. A bartender, cook, or FOH staff does not qualify.
- **H-2B Visa** (temporary non-agricultural workers): applicable to seasonal hospitality roles. Requires a US labor market test (attestation that no qualified US workers are available), cap subject (65,000/year nationally), and employer sponsorship. Complex, expensive (~$2,000–4,000 per applicant), and unreliable — caps are reached early. Timing uncertainty alone makes this risky for operational planning.
- **Work at a US business without authorization**: illegal for the employee, and the employer faces fines, loss of licenses, potential closure. Not an option.

**Assessment:** **[G]** Canadian nationals filling operational hourly roles is practically difficult and legally complex. The realistic labor market for cross-border staff is US citizens or persons with US work authorization who happen to live in Delta/Tsawwassen — a tiny population. *(→ OI-09: confirm with immigration attorney before assuming any Canadian labor model)*

---

### Q: Supply chain cost premium vs. mainland comparable

**[E]** Every commercial delivery — food, beverage, equipment, consumables — arrives via one of:
1. **Land through Canada** (most deliveries): subject to Canadian customs on northbound crossing, then US customs on southbound crossing back to Point Roberts. CBSA and CBP processing applies to commercial goods. US duty-free de minimis for commercial goods is $800 per shipment (informal entry threshold raised in 2023); items below this level can cross without formal entry. Most food truck deliveries will be above this threshold and require entry paperwork.
2. **Air freight** (Point Roberts Airpark): viable for small, high-value items; unworkable for bulk food/beverage.
3. **Boat/maritime** (Point Roberts Marina): viable in theory; freight economics are worse than trucking.

**[E]** Effective COGS premium from supply chain friction: **ESTIMATED 8–15% above mainland baseline.** Sources of premium:
- Limited supplier willingness to serve (adds surcharge or requires customer pick-up across border)
- Smaller order quantities (less storage space) → higher per-unit cost
- Perishables: any cross-border delay creates spoilage risk → higher waste buffer
- Duty on non-US-origin goods entering through Canada (though most food items have low or zero duty under USMCA)
- Time and staff cost for supply chain management is disproportionate to scale

**[V]** Note: Wikipedia confirms Point Roberts' single grocery store nearly closed during the pandemic and required a $100,000 emergency state grant to remain open. This is not a well-supplied market.

---

### Q: US member visit frequency — evidence from observed behavior at Point Roberts businesses

**[V]** US members (mainland Washington) face **four border crossings per visit**: WA → Canada → Point Roberts (arriving) and Point Roberts → Canada → WA (departing). Plus ~25 miles of Canadian highway at market speed limits.

**[E]** A round trip from Bellingham (the nearest US city of scale at ~92,000 population): ~45 min drive each way normally; 30–90 min border wait each direction in summer. Total round trip: 2–5 hours of travel for a beach club visit, before parking, entry, and activity time. This is not a spontaneous or casual use case.

**[E]** US member visit frequency at a Point Roberts club: **ESTIMATED materially lower than any comparable accessible club.** A typical urban or suburban beach club member might visit 10–30 times per season; a Point Roberts US member might visit 3–8 times per season.

**Assessment:** US membership is a secondary revenue source. Modeling US members at the same value-per-member as accessible comparables is a Rule 2 violation without a derivation that accounts for this access friction.

---

### Q: Canadian member fraction — current and projected

**[V]** The natural drawing market for Point Roberts businesses is Canadian:
- Tsawwassen (directly across the border): 20,933 people — 1 southbound crossing to reach Point Roberts
- Rest of Delta: further but still within 20 min drive across the border
- Vancouver proper: ~675,000 in the city, with Point Roberts as a known recreational destination
- Greater Metro Vancouver (GVRD): ~2.9 million — Point Roberts has historically been a popular weekend destination

**[V]** Wikipedia notes: "Canadians visit for cheaper American gasoline, alcohol, and food when the Canadian Dollar is strong." Historical use is primarily Canadian. Sunday drinking laws in BC until 1986 drove Canadian bar patronage to Point Roberts — that era is over, but the habit and recreational pattern persists for beach access and US pricing.

**[V]** 2025 complication: After Trump's 2025 tariffs on Canadian goods and "51st state" rhetoric, Canadian visitors to Point Roberts dropped by **30%**, with some businesses closing and others relocating to Canada. Wikipedia (June 2025 Guardian article): "Local people were concerned that Point Roberts as they know it could cease to exist."

**[E]** Under normal (pre-tariff) conditions: **ESTIMATED 70–80% of revenue at a Point Roberts venue is Canadian-sourced**, based on the described economy, mailbox count, and seasonal population composition.

**[E]** Under 2025 tariff conditions: Canadian visitor reduction of 30% implies **ESTIMATED 45–55% effective Canadian-sourced revenue** until political normalization.

**[G]** Fraction of a future private club's members who would be Canadian: **GUESSED 60–75% in a base case.** This reflects: (a) Canadians have better access (1 crossing vs. 4); (b) Point Roberts is an established Canadian recreational destination; (c) the mailbox economy shows ~48,000 Canadians have routine Point Roberts engagement. *(This must be supported by member demand research before use in the model.)*

**Risk flag per Rule 6:** A model that depends on 60–75% Canadian membership must explicitly model the border closure scenario (revenue → 0 from Canadian members in 18 months) and the political climate scenario (30% reduction, as documented in 2025). These are not tail risks — they are documented recent events.

---

### Q: Border closure scenario — 2020–2021 impacts on Point Roberts businesses

**[V]** March 2020 – August 2021 (~17 months): US-Canada land border closed to non-essential travel. Cross-border foot traffic to Point Roberts effectively halted.

**[V]** From Wikipedia (CDC News, September 2020): Point Roberts "lost 80 percent of its business and hundreds of seasonal residents." The community was described as a "ghost town." No confirmed COVID cases, but the economic impact was severe.

**[V]** Response: Washington State provided a $100,000 emergency grant to keep the single grocery store open. A temporary ferry to Blaine operated August 2020 – August 2021 (once or twice weekly) to provide supply chain access; it was insufficient for business operations.

**[V]** February 2021: Canada waived mandatory COVID testing for Point Roberts residents specifically after Washington State negotiations — acknowledging the unique dependency.

**Assessment:** A 17-month border closure scenario is not hypothetical. It happened within the last 5 years and destroyed 80% of Point Roberts business revenue. **Any financial model must include a border closure scenario and the model must demonstrate what cash reserves or alternative revenue are required to survive it.**

---

### Q: Lender terms — confirmed with lenders active in Point Roberts market

*(→ OI-08: not yet confirmed)*

**[G]** Preliminary estimate: **GUESSED 30–40% down payment required** (vs. 20–25% for standard commercial real estate), **GUESSED rate premium of 50–100bps** over equivalent mainland commercial property, based on:
- Penclave liquidity risk (suppressed buyer pool at exit)
- Documented event risk (COVID border closure)
- Small market with limited comparable transaction history

At $1,375,000 asking and 35% down:
- Down payment: $481,250
- Loan: $893,750
- At 7.5% / 20-year amortization: **~$7,140/month → $85,680/year debt service [E]**
- At 1.25× DSCR: minimum net operating income = **$107,100/year [E]** (before debt service, after all operating costs)

At 30% down:
- Down payment: $412,500
- Loan: $962,500
- At 7.5% / 20-year: **~$7,690/month → $92,280/year [E]**
- At 1.25× DSCR: minimum NOI = **$115,350/year [E]**

*Both scenarios are pre-cost-stack. The NOI floor above is the minimum from real estate alone, not including any staffing, COGS, program, or overhead. The actual breakeven is much higher.*

---

### Q: Real estate floor value with penclave liquidity discount

**[V]** Whatcom County assessed values (2025):
- Land: $669,526
- Improvements: $181,439
- Assessed total: $850,965
- Asking price: $1,375,000 — **61.6% premium over assessed value [V]**

**[E]** The improvement value of $181,439 on a 1959 building is consistent with a property that either has minimal structural value remaining or has been minimally updated. At $21/sqft of improvement (if building is 8,463 sqft — see OI-03), this suggests the improvements are worth very little — the vast majority of value is in the land.

**[E]** Land value as primary component: $669,526 of assessed value is land. This is reasonable for a waterfront/near-waterfront RESORT COMM parcel in Point Roberts.

**[E]** Floor value in a penclave: The buyer pool for any Point Roberts property is limited to those willing to accept penclave access. This restricts exit to: (a) other hospitality/tourist operators who also want the location; (b) residential conversion (would require rezoning); (c) other Canadian or US buyers attracted to the waterfront access specifically. This is a thin market.

**[G]** Floor value estimate with penclave discount: **GUESSED $750,000–$900,000** in a distressed or forced sale, representing a 7–12% discount to assessed value and a 35–45% discount to asking price. Note this discount would be larger if the club concept has failed and the building needs further CAPEX.

**Open issue:** Need price-per-sqft trend data for Point Roberts commercial properties vs. mainland Whatcom County to calibrate this more precisely. *(→ implicitly OI-08 or a separate comparable transaction search)*

---

### Q: Utilities and infrastructure — sources and redundancy

*(→ OI-10: not yet confirmed)*

**[V / E based on Wikipedia context]:**
- **Water**: Point Roberts Water District #4 purchases raw water from Greater Vancouver Water District (Delta). **The water supply is Canadian-sourced.** This is a structural dependency. An agreement signed 1987 governs this. A water-related dispute or border closure could affect supply. *(This is a verified penclave utility dependency.)*
- **Power**: Not confirmed — but BC Hydro serves Delta immediately to the north. It's plausible that some Point Roberts power infrastructure is connected to or crosses through Canadian infrastructure, though US utilities may serve the area. *(→ OI-10: confirm power source)*
- **Telecommunications**: Whidbey Telecom provides broadband. Previously BCTel/Telus served the area. Fiber construction began 2019. *(→ OI-10: confirm current broadband reliability for POS/reservation systems)*
- **Waste/septic**: Likely on-site or local municipal. *(→ OI-10: confirm)*

**Assessment:** Water is confirmed to be Canadian-sourced under a bilateral contract. This is not a daily risk, but in any border dispute or supply infrastructure failure, the business loses water. Appears to have survived the COVID closure without water interruption (agreement seems robust), but adds to the catalog of Canadian dependencies.

---

### Q: Emergency services coverage and insurance implications

*(→ OI-11: not yet confirmed)*

**[V]** Wikipedia: "Delta Fire Department also provides assistance to the Point Roberts volunteer fire department when requested." — Point Roberts has a **volunteer fire department**, with Delta's professional fire service as backup. This is cross-border emergency response.

**[E]** Implications:
- Fire response will be slower than mainland commercial properties — volunteer departments have longer response times by definition.
- A border closure would impair Delta Fire Department's ability to assist. *(This is a rare but non-zero scenario.)*
- Insurance for a commercial property with a volunteer fire department and cross-border backup may carry a premium.
- **Medical**: No hospital in Point Roberts. Residents use Bellingham for healthcare (not Vancouver, due to insurance), requiring two border crossings. A serious injury or fire is a materially worse emergency situation than any mainland site.

**[G]** Insurance premium estimate: **GUESSED +10–20% above a comparable mainland commercial hospitality property**, recognizing volunteer fire coverage, cross-border response, and penclave-specific risk profiling. *(→ OI-11: get an actual quote before any model uses a number)*

---

## 2. Dimension 1 — Acquisition Type Assessment

### Q: What is included in the $1,375,000 asking price?

*(→ OI-01: must be confirmed with seller/listing)*

**[G]** Best guess on typical structure for a commercial bar sale in WA:
- Real estate (land + building): included — the listing is listed as real property
- Liquor license: **likely included** in the asking price as a key component of value — WA liquor licenses have value and typically transfer with a business sale
- Equipment (commercial kitchen, bar equipment, furniture): **likely included** as fixtures and equipment
- Goodwill / customer list / brand: **likely minimal / zero** given conversion intent — and the framework requires we treat this as zero regardless

**Assessment:** Cannot allocate value between components without seller disclosure. For floor value purposes, assume real estate is the dominant value (land $669K assessed). The liquor license and equipment are either negotiating tools or near-zero additional value depending on their condition and applicability to the new use.

---

### Q: License status — what exists, what does it permit, is it transferable?

*(→ OI-02: WSLCB lookup required)*

**[V]** Current Whatcom County use code: DRINK PLACES / C-RST (Commercial Restaurant). This tells us a license exists and the business has been operating as a bar/restaurant.

**[E]** In Washington State, a liquor license is issued by the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (WSLCB). Common classes for a bar/restaurant: Class 12 (restaurant) or Class 14 (tavern, beer/wine only). Point Roberts has historically been known for its bars catering to Canadians.

**[G]** For conversion to a private club: WA has a specific license class for private clubs — **Class 6 (Private Club)**. This is a different license class that permits member-only service. A transfer from Class 12/14 to Class 6 is a change of use that requires WSLCB approval of the new entity and new use. It is not automatic.

**[G]** Timeline for new/converted license: **GUESSED 3–9 months** for new entity license or change-of-use at WSLCB. This adds to conversion timeline and carry costs.

**Risk flag:** Liquor license issuance in Washington is not guaranteed. If the WSLCB denies the private club license, the revenue model for F&B collapses. This is a go/no-go gating item.

---

### Q: Building physical condition — required capital costs before opening

*(→ OI-04: inspection required — the following is desk research only)*

**[V]** Built: 1959. Age: 66+ years.

**[V]** Improvement value: $181,439 (Whatcom County 2025). At this assessed improvement value, the building has minimal residual structural value in the county's view.

**[E]** 1959 commercial construction typically means:
- Likely single-wall or minimal-insulation framing
- Potentially asbestos-containing materials (ACM) in insulation, tile, siding — pre-1980 construction; abatement required before renovation
- Lead paint: pre-1978, likely present
- Electrical: likely original or partially updated; will need full inspection to code
- Plumbing: likely original galvanized or early copper; may need replacement
- HVAC: likely original or outdated; commercial kitchen exhaust compliance required
- ADA compliance: significant likelihood of non-compliance; required for any commercial renovation that increases square footage of use change

**[G]** Minimum capital cost to convert to a functional private club (assuming building is structurally sound): **GUESSED $250,000–$500,000**, covering:
- Hazmat assessment + abatement (asbestos/lead): $20,000–60,000
- Electrical upgrade to code: $30,000–80,000
- Plumbing: $20,000–50,000
- HVAC: $30,000–70,000
- Interior renovation (flooring, bar, kitchen refresh, ADA): $100,000–200,000
- Permits: $10,000–25,000

**[G]** If structural issues are found (foundation, framing): add $100,000–300,000. *(This is why inspection is gating — the range between "cosmetic refresh" and "gut renovation" is enormous on a 1959 building.)*

---

### Q: Conversion timeline and carry costs

**[E]** Minimum realistic conversion timeline from purchase to first member use: **ESTIMATED 12–18 months**, composed of:
- Due diligence and closing: 60–90 days
- Hazmat inspection and permits: 30–60 days
- Renovation: 6–9 months (conservative for 1959 building)
- WSLCB license processing: 3–9 months (can overlap with renovation)
- Member recruitment: ongoing from 6 months before opening

**[E]** Carry costs during conversion (before any revenue):
- Debt service (at $85,000–92,000/year): **~$106,000–138,000 [E]** for 15–18 months
- Property tax: **~$18,000–22,000 [E]** (based on current assessed value ~$850K, typical WA rate ~1.1-1.5%)
- Utilities (minimal — lights, heat, water during construction): **~$12,000–18,000 [E]**
- Insurance (vacant commercial + construction): **~$10,000–20,000 [E]** per year
- **Total carry cost estimate: ~$150,000–200,000 [E]** for a 15-18 month conversion

**This is money spent before the first dollar of revenue.** Combined with the renovation capital ($250,000–500,000), total pre-revenue investment above and beyond the purchase price: **ESTIMATED $400,000–700,000 [E]**.

---

### Q: Real estate floor value

Addressed in Penclave section above. Summary: **[G] $750,000–$900,000** in distressed sale. The land ($669K assessed) is the load-bearing value component.

---

## 3. Dimension 2 — Business Type Assessment

### Q: Building square footage and maximum covers

*(→ OI-03: ambiguous field in parcel data)*

**[V / ambiguous]** Whatcom County parcel data returns `sqft = 8,463`. For commercial parcels in Whatcom County's data, this field can represent either lot area or building footprint, depending on data source. Given the improvement value of only $181,439 and the context of a small waterfront bar:

**[E]** If 8,463 sqft is the **lot size** (more likely): the building footprint is probably **1,500–3,000 sqft [E]** for a small waterfront bar/restaurant built in 1959.

**[E]** If 8,463 sqft is the **building footprint** (less likely): this would be a large venue — 8,000+ sqft of commercial restaurant space with an improvement value of $181K is implausible (~$21/sqft). This doesn't hold.

**[E]** Estimated building footprint: **1,500–2,500 sqft [E]** of interior usable space, likely with outdoor deck area. At standard restaurant density (15 sqft/cover interior):
- Low: 1,500 sqft interior → **~100 covers [E]** (generous, likely some is kitchen/storage)
- Mid: 2,000 sqft usable interior → **~60-80 covers [E]** at restaurant density; 40-50 covers at club lounge density (more space per person)
- Outdoor: deck/patio likely adds seasonal capacity; not reliable in off-season

**[G]** Working assumption for model: **40-60 interior covers + 20-40 summer deck [G]**, based on typical small waterfront bar footprint. *(→ OI-03: must be confirmed with actual building permit records or site visit before any F&B ceiling calculation)*

---

### Q: F&B revenue ceiling

Per the framework, maximum F&B revenue is physically bounded.

**[E]** F&B ceiling formula: covers × turns per day × average check × operating days

Using mid-case estimates:
- Covers: 50 interior
- Turns: 2 per day (lunch + dinner service; premium venue, not fast casual)
- Average check: $45/person (drinks + food, comparable to upscale casual)
- Peak season days (beach weather, high demand): ~75 days [E] (mid-June to Labor Day, weekends only during shoulder)
- Shoulder season (year-round food/bar operation, reduced covers): ~100 days/year [G]

Peak season F&B: 50 covers × 2 turns × $45 × 75 days = **$337,500 [E]**
Shoulder/year-round: 30 covers × 1.5 turns × $40 × 100 days = **$180,000 [E]**
**Total F&B revenue ceiling: ~$500,000–$520,000/year [E]**

This is a **physical ceiling** at these assumptions. Actual revenue will be less (not every day is full, not every turn is complete). A conservative realization of 60% of ceiling = ~$300,000/year.

**This is the F&B ceiling — not the F&B projection.** F&B at 60% of ceiling minus COGS (30%) minus F&B-specific labor minus supplies still needs to net positive.

---

### Q: Usable season length

**[V]** Climate: Point Roberts has an oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb). From Delta/Tsawwassen climate data:
- July average high: 21.7°C (71°F); August 21.5°C (70°F)
- June average high: 19.6°C (67°F)
- September average high: 18.4°C (65°F)
- Rainfall: well-distributed through year; July/August are the driest months (30.5mm/28.7mm respectively)

**[E]** Comfortable beach weather (warm enough for beach use, low precipitation): **mid-June through mid-September — approximately 13 weeks [E]**. Outside this window, temperatures are mild but not beach weather.

**[E]** Club operating season:
- **Beach season**: 13 weeks — highest demand, full F&B, outdoor use
- **Warm shoulder** (May, late Sep): 4–6 weeks — reduced but viable for events and lounge use
- **Off-season** (Oct–Apr): viable as a members' lounge, lower F&B revenue; Canadian seasonal members have vacated Point Roberts for the winter

**Assessment:** Revenue is **highly concentrated in 13 weeks [E]**. Off-season operation covers minimal fixed costs. The model must work as a seasonal business, not an annualized average.

---

### Q: Member draw population within the friction boundary

**[E]** The "friction boundary" for a Point Roberts club is defined by willingness to cross borders:

**Tier 1 — Canadian members (1 crossing, ~10–20 min drive from Tsawwassen):**
- Tsawwassen, immediately adjacent: 20,933
- Ladner: 21,112
- White Rock/South Surrey: ~110,000 (20–30 min with no traffic)
- **Total addressable Tier 1 Canadian market: ~150,000–180,000 people [E]**

**Tier 2 — Canadian members (further metro Vancouver, 30–60 min drive + 1 crossing):**
- Richmond: ~232,000
- Vancouver proper: ~675,000
- Surrey: ~590,000
- Burnaby: ~260,000
- **Total Tier 2: ~1.7M+ — but this is the same population that could access Ambleside Beach in West Vancouver or Spanish Banks without any border crossing. The friction barrier is real here.**

**[E]** Realistic Canadian addressable market: Tier 1 is the primary draw. **~150,000–200,000 people within 30 min + 1 crossing [E]**. Tier 2 adds marginal members willing to pay a premium for exclusive waterfront access specifically.

**Tier 3 — US members (4 crossings, Bellingham ~92,000; Anacortes ~18,000; Whatcom County ~230,000):**
- The 4-crossing barrier means US members are true enthusiasts who specifically value this location. Not incidental or convenience-driven.
- **Realistic US addressable market: ~20,000–30,000 people [E]** with any serious likelihood of membership consideration.

**Total active addressable market: [E] ~170,000–230,000 people** — this is the pool from which any membership must come. Penetration rate for a private club in the <1% range implies 170–2,300 potential members.

### Q: Minimum viable staffing headcount to operate on a given day

**[E]** Minimum viable staffing for a beach club day with F&B:
- General Manager: 1 (salaried, not per-shift) — needed for operations, compliance, member relations
- Kitchen: 1 line cook minimum; 2 on busy days — **call it 1.5 FTE [E]**
- Front of house (bar + service): 1 bartender + 1 server minimum; 2+2 on peak days — **call it 2 FTE [E]**
- **Minimum operating shift: GM + 1 cook + 1 bartender = 3 people minimum [E]**
- **Peak operating shift: GM + 2 cooks + 2 bartenders + 2 servers = 7 people [E]**

**[E]** Annual labor cost structure (rough, cost-first):
- GM: $130,000–160,000 fully loaded (salary + benefits + penclave premium) [E]
- Line cook (1.5 FTE equivalent, seasonal + shoulder): $55,000–70,000/year [E]
- Bartender (1.5 FTE equivalent): $50,000–65,000/year [E]
- Server (1.0 FTE, peak season): $35,000–45,000/year [E]
- Part-time / events support (0.5 FTE): $20,000–25,000/year [E]
- **Total labor: $290,000–365,000/year [E]**

**[E]** Compare to Mercer Island Beach Club 2024 (much larger, urban, ~$3.2M revenue): $924K salaries. That's 28% of revenue on salaries. On a $1M revenue model for The Reef, $290K–365K is 29–37% of revenue — consistent but tight. The penclave premium pushes this toward the high end.

### Q: Comparable dues within 200 miles

*(→ OI-07: not confirmed — the following is research-based estimation)*

**[E]** No direct comparables (private beach club, waterfront, remote, border-adjacent) found within 200 miles with confirmed dues data. The closest structural analogs are:

- **Mercer Island Beach Club** (WA, suburban, non-remote): Revenue per member not calculable from 990 without membership count. Total 2024 revenue $3.23M. If we guess 400 members: implies ~$8,000/member/year average (dues + F&B + fees). Dues alone probably $4,000–6,000/year. **[G]**
- **Seabright Beach Club** (NJ, coastal, established): 2024 revenue $3.35M. Private beach clubs in coastal NJ range from $3,000–12,000/year in dues.
- **Standard US private club industry**: Dues range from $3,000–15,000/year depending on market, amenities, exclusivity.

**[G]** Working assumption for break-even analysis: **$4,000–$8,000/year dues [G]** per member. Range reflects: premium for destination/exclusivity factor offset by penclave access friction (which reduces what members will pay for the same physical experience).

---

### Q: Break-even member count

This requires the full cost stack, which is a financial model task (not yet built). But a rough floor check:

**[E]** Minimum annual cost stack before F&B:
- Debt service: $85,000–92,000 [E]
- Property tax: ~$18,000 [E]
- Labor (operations only): $290,000–365,000 [E]
- Utilities: $24,000–36,000 [G]
- Insurance (with penclave premium): $18,000–28,000 [G]
- COGS for F&B (at 60% of ceiling × 30% cost): ~$90,000 [E]
- Maintenance/repair on a 1959 building: $20,000–40,000/year [G]
- Admin, accounting, legal, WSLCB compliance: $15,000–25,000 [G]
- **Total minimum annual operating cost: ~$560,000–700,000/year [E]**

**[E]** Revenue to cover this cost stack:
- F&B contribution (60% of ceiling × 70% gross margin): ~$210,000/year [E]
- Events and other: $20,000–40,000/year [G]
- **Net non-dues revenue: ~$230,000–$250,000 [E]**

**[E]** Remaining to cover from dues: $310,000–$450,000/year

**[E]** Break-even member count by dues level:
- At $4,000/year dues: **77–113 members [E]**
- At $6,000/year dues: **52–75 members [E]**
- At $8,000/year dues: **39–56 members [E]**

**Assessment:** Minimum viable scale is **50–100 members [E]** depending on dues pricing. This is a achievable founding membership target but not trivial. Month-one zero revenue on a $560K+ cost base is a capital requirement, not an income statement item.

## 4. Dimension 3 — Real Estate Assessment

### Q: Asking cap rate

The cap rate is circular without a finalized income model, but a floor check is possible.

**[E]** If the stabilized club generates $560,000–700,000 in operating expenses and $500,000–600,000 in gross revenue (before F&B margins):

At a $1,375,000 purchase price, a market cap rate for small commercial waterfront in rural WA is probably **6–8% [G]**.
- At 6% cap rate: implies NOI of $82,500/year
- At 8% cap rate: implies NOI of $110,000/year

The implied NOI at market cap rates is **$82,500–$110,000/year [E]**. This is below the $290K–365K labor cost alone. This tells us: **at asking price, this property does not underwrite as a stabilized income property at market cap rates. It is a speculative / conversion play priced for the concept, not the current cash flow.**

This is not a failure condition — it is the expected structure of a Conversion. But it means the underwriting is purely on the success of the club concept, not on real estate fundamentals.

---

### Q: DSCR at proposed financing terms

**[E]** At $85,000–92,000/year debt service and minimum NOI requirement of 1.25× DSCR:
- Required NOI: $106,000–115,000/year
- This is after all operating expenses and before debt service.
- From the cost stack analysis above, a 50-member club at $6,000/year dues generates roughly: $300,000 dues + $250,000 F&B contribution − $560,000 costs = **−$10,000 to +$40,000 NOI [E]**. This does not meet 1.25× DSCR.
- A 75-member club at $6,000/year dues: $450,000 dues + $250,000 F&B − $580,000 costs = **$120,000 NOI [E]**. This barely meets DSCR at 1.25× of $92,000.

**Assessment:** The break-even is tight. **A lender applying standard 1.25× DSCR would require approximately 70–80 members at $6,000/year dues before the loan underwrites [E].** This is the founding member critical mass. Below this, the deal requires additional equity or a lower purchase price to service debt.

### Q: Exit / floor value

Covered in Penclave section. **[G] $750,000–$900,000** in distressed exit. At the $1,375,000 purchase price, the **downside in a forced sale is a $475,000–$625,000 loss [E]** before renovation costs. With renovation ($250K–500K), the total loss risk in a failed scenario reaches **$725,000–$1,125,000 [E]**.

**This is the answer to Rule 5 (the model must be able to say NO):** the deal fails if: (a) founding membership target not met within 18 months, (b) Canadian border conditions deteriorate further (tariff/political climate), or (c) renovation costs exceed the upper estimate. Each of these is a clearly defined failure condition.

---

### Q: Zoning and use constraints

*(→ OI-12: confirm with Whatcom County planning)*

**[V]** Current zoning: RESORT COMM (Resort Commercial) — Whatcom County

**[E]** Resort Commercial zoning in Whatcom County typically permits: hotels, motels, restaurants, retail, recreational facilities, and associated commercial uses. A private membership beach club is likely permitted as a "recreational facility" or "membership club" within this zone.

**[E]** Change of use from "tavern/bar" (DRINK PLACES) to "private club": in WA, a change of use typically triggers a building permit, which triggers a full code compliance review (ADA, fire code, etc.) on the affected areas of the building. This is consistent with the renovation cost estimate above.

**[G]** No obvious zoning barrier to a private club conversion in RESORT COMM, but this must be confirmed. If Point Roberts-specific overlays apply (e.g., shoreline management regulations, critical areas ordinances near the waterfront), those could materially constrain exterior modifications or deck expansion. *(→ OI-12)*

## 5. Summary: What We Know Enough to Model vs. What We Don't

### Sufficient to proceed with cost-first model (with flagged estimates):
- [E] Labor cost stack: $290,000–$365,000/year
- [E] Debt service: $85,000–92,000/year (pending lender confirmation — OI-08)
- [E] Property tax, utilities, insurance rough estimates
- [E] F&B revenue ceiling: ~$500,000/year; realistic contribution: ~$250,000/year
- [E] Break-even member count: 50–100 members depending on dues level
- [E] Conversion timeline: 12–18 months; carry cost: $150,000–$200,000
- [E] Renovation capital requirement: $250,000–$500,000

### Not sufficient to model (gating open items):
- **OI-01**: What's included in the ask — cannot allocate equity between real estate, license, equipment
- **OI-02**: License transferability — if license doesn't transfer cleanly to private club use, F&B revenue assumption is void
- **OI-03**: Building sqft / cover count — F&B ceiling calculation is based on an estimate; could be 50% off
- **OI-04**: Physical condition — renovation capital estimate range of $250K–$500K is too wide for a financial model; inspection needed to narrow it
- **OI-05**: Peak summer border waits — needed to calibrate Canadian member visit frequency (impacts dues value and F&B load)
- **OI-07**: Comparable dues data — current dues assumption is a wide guess and directly drives break-even member count
- **OI-08**: Lender terms — down payment and rate drive capital requirement and DSCR calculation

## 6. Preliminary Pass/Fail Indicators

Per Rule 5, these are the conditions that would make this deal unworkable:

| Indicator | Threshold | Current Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| Renovation cost | >$600,000 | Unknown — requires inspection (OI-04) |
| Founding membership target | <50 members at $6,000 dues in year 1 | No market data yet — needs member demand testing |
| Canadian share of membership | <40% | If tariff/political climate persists at 30% visitor reduction, Canadian demand is structurally impaired |
| Lender won't finance | Requires >45% down | Would raise total equity requirement to $618,750+ plus renovation, pushing total capital >$1.2M |
| License doesn't transfer to private club class | WSLCB denial | G/No-go gating item — must be confirmed before any modeling |
| Border closure (18-month scenario) | Revenue drops to near-zero | Requires cash reserve of ~$700,000–$1,000,000 to survive; or deal is unviable without this backstop |
