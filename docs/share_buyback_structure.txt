Yes. What you are describing is usually handled with **shareholder agreement / unanimous shareholder agreement (USA)** transfer provisions plus a **buy-sell / liquidity mechanism**.

## Common agreement structures that match your goal

### 1) Right of First Refusal (ROFR) + “market test” + fallback buyout

**How it works**

* A shareholder who wants liquidity must first try to sell to a third party (a defined “market test”: minimum time, approved broker/process, minimum price, etc.).
* If they get a bona fide offer, the company and/or other shareholders get the right to buy **on the same terms** (ROFR). ([queenslawclinics.ca][1])
* If no third-party sale closes by a deadline (or no acceptable offer is received), a **fallback** triggers:

  * company redemption (buyback), or
  * mandatory purchase by other shareholders, or
  * a company-led secondary (see #4).

**How you implement “based on what price they could not sell for”**

* Define “Failed Sale Price” as either:

  * the highest bona fide third-party offer received during the market test, or
  * the shareholder’s minimum asking price if the process met defined requirements (often harder to justify), or
  * an appraised/fair-market-value price via a valuator (more defensible).
* Then the fallback buyout price is set to the “Failed Sale Price” (sometimes with a discount or cap).

### 2) Put option / redemption right (seller can force liquidity)

This is the cleanest “if I can’t sell, someone must buy” tool.

**How it works**

* After a market test (or after a holding period), the shareholder gets a **put right**: they can require the company (or other shareholders) to purchase their shares.
* Price is set by a formula, appraisal, or a defined reference transaction.

This is not unusual conceptually; it is just negotiated hard because it creates a contingent liquidity obligation for the company.

### 3) Shotgun (“buy-sell”) clause (price-setting mechanism)

If your core need is a **set price mechanism** that forces a transaction, the classic tool is a shotgun clause.

**How it works**

* One shareholder names a price per share.
* The other side must choose to **buy** the offeror’s shares or **sell** their own shares at that same price. ([MNP.ca][2])

This doesn’t require a third-party buyer at all; it creates an internal forced market. It can be adapted so the “shotgun price” is anchored to a failed external sale attempt (e.g., “price equals the highest bona fide third-party offer during the last 90 days”).

### 4) Company-led tender offers / internal secondary programs (periodic liquidity windows)

This is common in private companies with many holders (employees, early investors).

**How it works**

* The company periodically runs a **tender offer** or structured secondary transaction where eligible holders can sell a set amount at a predetermined price. ([Carta][3])

This is operationally heavier, but it avoids one-off disputes about whether the shareholder “really tried” to sell.

## Your specific “buy other shares at a set price if I can’t sell mine”

That exact swap is not a standard default clause, but it can be drafted as a **forced internal exchange** using familiar building blocks:

* Run a **market test + ROFR** first (proves the price). ([Kelly Santini LLP][4])
* If the sale fails, trigger either:

  * a **put** (company/others must buy the shares at the “Failed Sale Price”), or
  * a **shotgun-style election** where the liquidity-seeking holder can instead buy an equivalent value of other shareholders’ shares at the same per-share price (requires careful limits + funding proof + minority protections). ([MNP.ca][2])

Practically, most agreements choose “failed sale → mandatory buyout” rather than “failed sale → right to buy others,” because the latter can be coercive unless tightly constrained (who must sell, pro-rata mechanics, financing timelines, oppression/minority protections, etc.). ([Canadian Bar Association][5])

## Key drafting decisions (the parts that make or break it)

* **What counts as a valid market test** (time, marketing steps, offer form, arm’s-length requirement).
* **Price definition** (highest bona fide offer vs. appraisal vs. formula). ([Virtus Group][6])
* **Who is the buyer of last resort** (company redemption vs. pro-rata shareholders vs. specific holders).
* **Payment terms** (cash vs. promissory note; interest; security; installment schedule).
* **Caps/solvency limits** if the company is the buyer (corporate law constraints vary by jurisdiction).
* **Minority protections** if using shotgun or forced sales (courts focus on fairness/reasonable expectations). ([Canadian Bar Association][5])

If you tell me the jurisdiction (Canada province / US state) and whether this is a closely held operating company vs. a venture-backed cap table, I can map your requirement to a concrete clause structure (defined terms + trigger sequence + pricing waterfall) in the format typically used in a shareholder agreement.
