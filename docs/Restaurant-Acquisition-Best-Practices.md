## Financial Due Diligence

### The Golden Rule
**NEVER trust the seller's numbers without independent verification.**

### Essential Financial Documents

**Minimum Required (3 Years):**
- [ ] Business tax returns (complete, all schedules)
- [ ] Personal tax returns of owner (if pass-through entity)
- [ ] Monthly P&L statements (detailed)
- [ ] Balance sheets (year-end minimum)
- [ ] Sales reports (POS system data)
- [ ] Sales tax returns (verify gross receipts)
- [ ] Bank statements (verify deposits)
- [ ] Accounts payable aging
- [ ] Accounts receivable (catering, events)

**Current Information:**
- [ ] Year-to-date P&L (current month)
- [ ] Current month sales (daily breakdown)
- [ ] Reservation/booking calendar
- [ ] Current inventory value
- [ ] Current vendor accounts status

### Financial Analysis Process

#### Step 1: Verify Revenue

**Cross-Reference Multiple Sources:**
```
Reported Sales = Tax Returns = Sales Tax Filings = Bank Deposits = POS Reports
```

**Red Flags:**
- ⚠️ Significant unexplained cash deposits
- ⚠️ Declining revenue trend (year-over-year)
- ⚠️ Sales tax filings don't match reported revenue
- ⚠️ Bank deposits significantly lower than reported sales
- ⚠️ Inconsistent record-keeping
- ⚠️ Missing documentation for certain periods

**Restaurant-Specific Verification:**
- Request POS system reports (can't easily be altered)
- Analyze credit card processing statements
- Review alcohol invoices vs. pour cost (should be 18-22%)
- Check food invoices vs. food cost (should be 28-35%)
- Request guest count data and average check

#### Step 2: Analyze Expenses

**Critical Expense Categories:**

| Expense | Industry Benchmark | Warning Signs |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) | 28-35% of sales | >38% = waste, theft, poor pricing |
| Labor (including payroll taxes) | 30-35% of sales | >40% = overstaffed or poor scheduling |
| **Prime Cost (COGS + Labor)** | **<65% of sales** | **>70% = unprofitable** |
| Occupancy (rent/mortgage, taxes) | 6-10% of sales | >12% = overpriced location |
| Marketing | 2-5% of sales | <1% = growth problem |
| Utilities | 3-5% of sales | >6% = inefficient equipment |
| Repairs & Maintenance | 2-4% of sales | <1% = deferred maintenance |

**Adjustments for Seller's Ownership:**
- Add back owner's excessive salary (above market GM rate)
- Add back personal expenses run through business
- Remove one-time expenses (major repairs, legal issues)
- Add necessary repairs or deferred maintenance
- Adjust for below-market rent (if owner-owned building)

#### Step 3: Calculate True Cash Flow

**Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE) Method:**
```
Net Profit (from tax return)
+ Owner's salary and benefits
+ Interest expense
+ Depreciation and amortization
+ One-time expenses
+ Personal expenses
- Below-market rent adjustment
- Normalized manager salary (if you won't operate)
= Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE)
```

**EBITDA Method (for larger operations):**
```
Revenue
- Cost of Goods Sold
- Labor
- Operating Expenses
= EBITDA (before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization)
```

#### Step 4: Seasonal Analysis

**Critical for Tourism-Dependent Restaurants:**
- Break out revenue by month (5-year average)
- Identify peak season (summer, holidays)
- Identify slow season (winter, off-peak)
- Calculate revenue concentration (% in peak 3 months)
- Assess cash flow challenges in slow periods
- Verify winter operating plan

**Red Flag:** >60% of annual revenue in 3-month period = high seasonal risk

### Financial Red Flags Checklist

**STOP or Investigate Deeply If:**
- [ ] Seller refuses to provide tax returns
- [ ] Numbers don't reconcile across documents
- [ ] Consistent decline in revenue (3+ years)
- [ ] Prime cost above 70%
- [ ] No documentation for "cash" sales
- [ ] Significant unpaid taxes or liens
- [ ] Pending lawsuits or claims
- [ ] Multiple bookkeeping changes
- [ ] Owner vague about reasons for selling
- [ ] "Off the books" revenue claims
- [ ] Deferred payroll taxes

- [ ] Reach-in refrigerators
- [ ] Under-counter refrigeration
- [ ] Prep tables with refrigeration
- [ ] Ice machine (age, capacity, condition)
- [ ] Note: Commercial refrigeration units cost $5,000-$30,000+ each

**Dishwashing & Sanitation:**

#### Equipment Age Budgeting Rule

**Replacement Cost Planning:**
- Equipment 0-5 years: Good condition, budget 10% for repairs
- Equipment 5-10 years: Plan for repairs, budget 25% of replacement
- Equipment 10-15 years: Expect major repairs or replacement soon
- Equipment 15+ years: Budget FULL replacement cost

**Major Replacement Costs (Order of Magnitude):**
- Walk-in cooler/freezer: $15,000-$40,000 each
- Commercial range: $5,000-$15,000
- Fryer: $3,000-$8,000
- Dishwasher: $5,000-$15,000
- Hood system: $10,000-$30,000
- Ice machine: $2,000-$8,000
- HVAC system: $15,000-$50,000

**Budget Reality Check:**
If the building is 1959 vintage and "sold as-is," budget $50,000-$150,000 for deferred maintenance and equipment replacement within 2 years.

### Environmental Assessment

**Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA):**
- **Required for:** Commercial property financing
- **Cost:** $3,000-$5,000
- **Scope:** Historical use review, identify potential contamination
- **Red Flags:** Underground storage tanks, historical industrial use, contamination

**Specific Restaurant Concerns:**
- Grease trap maintenance and condition
- Waste disposal practices
- Refrigerant handling (older equipment)
- Chemical storage
- Waterfront properties: shoreline compliance, septic if applicable

---

## Valuation Methods

### Common Restaurant Valuation Approaches

#### 1. Multiple of Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE)

**Most Common for Small Restaurants (<$2M revenue)**

**Formula:**
```
Business Value = Adjusted SDE × Multiple
```

**Typical Multiples:**
- Small independent restaurant (high risk): 1.5-2.5× SDE
- Established restaurant (proven track record): 2.5-3.5× SDE
- Franchise or branded concept: 3.0-4.0× SDE
- High-growth or trophy asset: 3.5-5.0× SDE

**Example:**
```
Adjusted SDE: $180,000
Multiple: 2.8×
Business Value: $504,000
Plus: Real estate/land value
Total Value: $[Business + Real Estate]
```

**Factors Increasing Multiple:**
- Long operating history (10+ years)
- Prime location or waterfront
- Low owner involvement (absentee)
- Unique/irreplaceable concept
- Strong facilities and new equipment
- Transferable name recognition
- Growing revenue trend

**Factors Decreasing Multiple:**
- Short operating history (<3 years)
- Declining revenue
- High owner dependency
- Poor facility condition
- Uncertain lease terms
- Negative online reviews
- Heavy seasonal concentration

#### 2. Multiple of EBITDA

**Used for Larger Operations ($2M+ revenue)**

**Formula:**
```
Business Value = EBITDA × Multiple
```

**Typical Multiples:**
- Independent restaurant: 2.5-4.0× EBITDA
- Multi-unit or chain: 4.0-6.0× EBITDA
- Unique asset or hospitality venue: 3.5-5.5× EBITDA

#### 3. Asset-Based Valuation

**Appropriate When:**
- Business barely profitable or losing money
- Primary value is in real estate, equipment, or liquor license
- Buyer plans major repositioning

**Formula:**
```
Asset Value = Real Estate + Equipment + Inventory + Liquor License
Less: Liabilities assumed
```

**Example:**
```
Real estate (land + building): $1,000,000
Equipment at depreciated value: $150,000
Inventory: $15,000
Liquor license value: $25,000
Subtotal: $1,190,000
Less: Accounts payable: -$20,000
Net Asset Value: $1,170,000
```

#### 4. Revenue Multiple (Rough Benchmark)

**Rule of Thumb Only - NOT Appraisal Method**

**Typical Range:** 0.3× to 0.8× annual revenue

- Low end (0.3-0.4×): Struggling restaurant, poor margins
- Mid range (0.4-0.6×): Average performing restaurant
- High end (0.6-0.8×): Strong performer, great location

**Example:**
```
Annual Revenue: $1,300,000
Revenue Multiple: 0.5×
Implied Value: $650,000
```

### Valuing Real Estate + Business Together

**For Combined Property/Business Sales (Like The Reef):**

**Method 1: Separate Real Estate from Business**
```
Step 1: Value land and building (comparable sales method)
Step 2: Value business operation (SDE or EBITDA multiple)
Step 3: Total value = Real estate + Business value
```

**Method 2: Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)**
```
Property Value = Net Operating Income ÷ Cap Rate

Example:
NOI: $175,000
Cap Rate: 7% (market rate for waterfront commercial)
Value: $175,000 ÷ 0.07 = $2,500,000
```

**Method 3: Investment Return Analysis**
```
Determine required return: 15-20% for restaurant business
Calculate sustainable cash flow
Value = Cash Flow ÷ Required Return
```

### The Reef Valuation Example

**Given:**
- Purchase Price: $1,375,000
- Estimated EBITDA: $150,000-$210,000 (needs verification)
- Asset Value: Land + building + equipment

**Quick Analysis:**
```
At $150,000 EBITDA → 9.2× multiple (HIGH - suggests value in real estate)
At $210,000 EBITDA → 6.5× multiple (more reasonable for combined deal)

This suggests significant value is in the real estate/land/zoning, not just business operations.

Asset-Based Thinking:
- Land (waterfront, 1.04 acres, rare zoning): $800,000-$1,100,000
- Building & improvements: $200,000-$400,000
- Equipment: $50,000-$100,000
- Business goodwill & liquor license: $100,000-$200,000
Estimated Asset Value: $1,150,000-$1,800,000
```

**Conclusion:** At $1,375,000, the property appears reasonably priced IF:
- Business financials verify $150K+ EBITDA
- No major deferred maintenance (probably not realistic for 1959 building)
- Liquor license transfers smoothly
- Zoning allows flexible future use

## Negotiation Strategy

### Information is Power

**Know More Than the Seller Thinks You Know:**
- Research comparable sales exhaustively
- Understand seller's motivation (retirement, health, partnership dissolution?)
- Know days on market and previous listing history
- Identify weaknesses in business or property
- Have inspection estimates ready

### Negotiation Leverage Points

**Use These to Negotiate Price or Terms:**

1. **Deferred Maintenance**
   - "Inspection revealed $75,000 in needed repairs"
   - Request: Price reduction or seller repairs

2. **Declining Performance**
   - "Revenue down 15% over 3 years"
   - Request: Lower price to reflect risk

3. **As-Is Condition**
   - "Given as-is sale, we need room for unknowns"
   - Request: Price reduction or extended due diligence

4. **Days on Market**
   - "Listed 90+ days suggests pricing issue"
   - Request: More aggressive offer, slow negotiation

5. **Seasonal Timing**
   - "Buying in off-season increases risk"
   - Request: Price adjustment or seller financing

6. **Market Comparables**
   - "Similar properties sold for $X less per sqft"
   - Request: Price to match market data

### Deal Structure Options

**Beyond Just Price:**

#### Seller Financing
**Structure:**
- Buyer pays 20-30% down
- Seller carries note for balance
- Interest rate: 6-8%
- Term: 5-10 years
- May include balloon payment

**Benefits:**
- Easier qualification
- Seller shows confidence in business
- Faster closing (less bank complexity)
- Tax benefits for seller

**Risks:**
- Seller can foreclose if you default
- May include onerous terms (personal guarantee, collateral)

#### Earnout Provisions
**Structure:**
- Base price + additional payments based on performance
- Example: $1,200,000 now + $75,000 if revenue exceeds $X in Year 1

**Benefits:**
- Reduces upfront risk
- Aligns buyer and seller incentives
- Seller proves business value

**Risks:**
- Complexity in defining metrics
- Potential disputes over performance
- May require ongoing seller involvement

#### Equipment Holdback
**Structure:**
- Negotiate certain equipment excluded from purchase
- Seller removes equipment OR
- Buyer purchases separately at lower value

**Benefits:**
- Reduces purchase price (helps with financing)
- Reflects true equipment age/value

#### Consulting/Transition Agreement
**Structure:**
- Seller stays on 30-90 days as consultant
- Paid training/transition fee
- Helps introduce buyers to customers, staff, vendors

**Benefits:**
- Smoother transition
- Knowledge transfer
- Customer retention

**Typical Fee:** $5,000-$15,000 for 30-60 days

### Contingencies to Protect Yourself

**Non-Negotiable Contingencies:**

1. **Satisfactory Review of Financials**
   - Vague enough to give exit option
   - Specific: verify 3 years tax returns, P&L statements

2. **Property Inspection**
   - 30-45 day period
   - Right to renegotiate or terminate based on findings

3. **Transfer of All Licenses**
   - Liquor license MUST transfer
   - Health permits, business licenses

4. **Financing Approval**
   - If not cash purchase
   - Protect earnest money if financing falls through

5. **Clear Title**
   - No liens, encumbrances
   - Right to marketable title

6. **Verification of Contracts**
   - All leases, agreements assigned or terminated
   - No hidden liabilities

**Additional Protective Contingencies:**

7. **Environmental Assessment**
   - Phase I ESA satisfactory
   - No contamination or required cleanup

8. **Attorney Review**
   - All documents reviewed and approved

9. **No Material Adverse Change**
   - Business performance doesn't decline >15% during due diligence

10. **Seller Training**
    - Seller agrees to X days of transition support

### Earnest Money Strategy

**Amount:**
- Typical: 1-5% of purchase price
- Small deposit ($5,000-$10,000): Shows interest but low risk
- Larger deposit (3-5%): Shows serious intent, stronger negotiating position

**Protection:**
- ALWAYS include contingency periods
- Ensure earnest money is refundable during due diligence
- Use escrow account at reputable title company
- Understand forfeiture conditions

### Closing Timeline

**Typical Timeline:**
- 60-90 days for business + real estate (longer than residential)
- 30-45 days due diligence period
- 15-30 days for liquor license process
- 15-30 days for financing approval

**Negotiate Length Based On:**
- Complexity (longer for restaurant + real estate)
- Financing needs (SBA loans take longer)
- License transfer time (check local requirements)
- Seller's urgency (quick close may get price concession)
