**Date:** February 19, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

Converting **The Reef** from a traditional public restaurant/bar to a private club model presents a compelling alternative business strategy.

- 📊 Better cash flow (annual dues paid upfront)
- 🏖️ Leverages unique waterfront/beach access
- 🇨🇦 Appeals to affluent Vancouver market seeking U.S. club access
- 🔒 Exclusive positioning commands premium pricing
- 📉 Potentially lower operating costs (controlled capacity)

## Club Concept Options

### Option 1: Beach & Yacht Club (RECOMMENDED)

**Concept:** Exclusive waterfront club offering beach access, dining, events, and marine amenities

**Target Market:**
- Vancouver-area high-net-worth individuals (30 min drive)
- Seattle-area boaters and weekenders
- Point Roberts property owners
- Cross-border professionals
- Retirees seeking coastal lifestyle

**Facilities & Amenities:**
- Private beach access (rare, high-value amenity)
- Waterfront dining room (members + guests)
- Bar & lounge with ocean views
- Event spaces (weddings, corporate retreats, private parties)
- Outdoor patio and fire pits
- Potential: Small fitness center or spa
- Seasonal programming (beach BBQs, sunset cocktails)
- Note: No dock currently; nearby Point Roberts marina available for boaters

**Membership Structure:**
- **Founding Members:** 50-100 @ $25,000-$50,000 initiation + $3,600-$6,000 annual
- **Full Members:** 200-300 total capacity @ $10,000-$20,000 initiation + $3,000-$5,000 annual
- **Social Members:** Limited access @ $2,500-$5,000 initiation + $1,500-$2,500 annual
- **Corporate Members:** Annual only @ $8,000-$15,000 annual (no initiation)

**Revenue Model:**
```
Founding Member Initiation (75 members @ $35,000): $2,625,000 (one-time)
Annual Dues (250 members @ $4,000 avg): $1,000,000/year
Food & Beverage (members pay, club margin): $400,000-$600,000/year
Events/Rentals (weddings, corporate): $150,000-$300,000/year
Guest Fees & Amenities: $50,000-$100,000/year

Total Annual Revenue (stabilized): $1,600,000-$2,000,000
Operating Expenses: $1,000,000-$1,300,000 (lower than public restaurant)
Net Operating Income: $600,000-$700,000 (higher margins than restaurant)
```

**Investment Required:**
- Property Purchase: $1,375,000
- Renovations/Improvements: $300,000-$500,000
- Initial Marketing/Launch: $100,000-$200,000
- Working Capital: $200,000
- **Total Investment:** $1,975,000-$2,275,000

**Payback Period:** 2-3 years (from initiation fees + dues)

---

### Option 2: Private Social Club

**Concept:** Exclusive dining and social club (no beach/marine focus)

**Similar To:** Metropolitan clubs, university clubs, private dining clubs

**Amenities:**
- Fine dining restaurant (reservation only)
- Private dining rooms
- Library/lounge
- Wine cellar/tasting room
- Business center
- Event spaces

**Membership:**
- 150-250 members
- $15,000-$25,000 initiation
- $3,000-$5,000 annual dues
- Members-only dining (guests allowed)

**Pros:**
- Less capital intensive (no marine development)
- Year-round appeal (less seasonal)
- Appeals to professionals and retirees

**Cons:**
- Doesn't leverage waterfront/beach as well
- Smaller market in Point Roberts
- Duplicates Vancouver's existing private clubs

**Estimated NOI:** $400,000-$500,000 annually

---

### Option 3: Nightclub / Entertainment Venue

**Concept:** Nightclub, live music venue, dance club

**⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED for Point Roberts**

**Why It Won't Work:**
- Very small local population (~1,300 residents)
- Border crossing required for most customers (closes 10pm-midnight)
- Residential neighbors (noise complaints)
- High operating costs for entertainment
- Seasonal tourism doesn't support year-round nightclub
- Liquor liability and security costs
- Point Roberts demographics (retirees, families)

**If You Were to Attempt:**
- Target 19-21 year old Canadians (drinking age 19 in BC, 21 in US)
- Summer weekends only
- Live music/DJ events
- Heavy security and transportation logistics
- Risk: Noise ordinances, neighbors, border timing

**Estimated NOI:** Likely negative or break-even (high risk)

---

### Option 4: Cannabis Lounge / Club

**Concept:** Private cannabis consumption lounge (legal in Washington)

**Legal Status:**
- Washington legalized recreational cannabis (2012)
- Private consumption clubs operate in gray area
- Social consumption not explicitly legal in public businesses
- Would need legal review of Point Roberts regulations

**Considerations:**
- Border crossing issue (cannabis illegal federally, can't cross border)
- Limits customer base to U.S. residents or those not crossing border same day
- Whatcom County and Point Roberts regulations
- Banking challenges (federal illegality)
- Liquor license conflicts

**⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED:** Legal complexity, border issues severely limit market

---

### Option 5: Sports & Recreation Club

**Concept:** Fitness, pickleball, tennis, swimming, recreation

**Space Constraints:**
- 8,643 sqft building (small for full gym)
- 1.04 acres (tight for courts unless waterfront unused)
- Would need significant development

**Better Suited For:** Larger property with more flat, developable land

**Potential Integration:** Small fitness center as amenity within Beach & Yacht Club

## Deep Dive: Beach & Yacht Club Model

### Why This Works for Point Roberts

**Geographic Advantage:**
1. **Unique U.S. Location Accessible from Vancouver**
   - Affluent Vancouver market (metro pop. 2.6M, median household income $80K CAD)
   - Cross-border appeal (U.S. club for Canadian members)
   - Tax advantages for Canadians (entertainment expenses, business use)
   - Currency advantage (varies, but historically CAD weaker than USD)

2. **Scarce Waterfront Amenity**
   - Very limited commercial waterfront in Point Roberts
   - Private beach access is rare and highly desirable
   - No other private clubs in Point Roberts
   - Closest competitors: Bellingham, Vancouver (both 45+ min away)

3. **Resort Commercial Zoning**
   - Flexible zoning accommodates club use
   - Event venue permitted
   - Food/beverage service allowed
   - Potential for expanded amenities

4. **Existing Infrastructure**
   - 8,643 sqft building ready for dining/events
   - Bar and commercial kitchen in place
   - Parking (RV parking noted = substantial lot)
   - Liquor license transferable

**Member Value Proposition:**

**For Vancouver Members ($35-50K Canadian for U.S. waterfront club):**
- Cross-border retreat (30 minutes from city)
- U.S. lifestyle experience
- Beach and waterfront access
- Year-round Pacific Northwest destination
- Business entertainment venue
- Weekend escape
- Currency diversification (assets in USD)

**For Seattle/Bellingham Members:**
- Unique coastal location
- Quiet, uncrowded beach access
- Private dining and events
- Weekend destination club
- Boating/marine access
- Networking with cross-border business community

**For Point Roberts Residents:**
- Local amenities in walkable location
- Community social hub
- Dining and entertainment
- Host guests from mainland
- Property value enhancement (nearby club access)

## Risk Analysis

### High-Priority Risks

**1. Membership Sales Shortfall**
- **Risk:** Don't sell enough founding/regular memberships
- **Impact:** Insufficient revenue, cash flow problems
- **Mitigation:**
  - Conduct thorough pre-launch market validation
  - Price competitively to drive demand
  - Flexible membership tiers (lower barrier options)
  - Strong sales and marketing effort
  - Offer incentives (early bird pricing, referral bonuses)

**2. Border Crossing Issues**
- **Risk:** Policy changes restrict cross-border travel
- **Impact:** Vancouver members can't access club regularly
- **Mitigation:**
  - Diversify membership base (Seattle, Bellingham, locals)
  - Focus on destination club appeal (worth the crossing)
  - Develop extended stay options (weekend packages)
  - Advocate for NEXUS/trusted traveler programs
  - COVID-19 showed risk - but also reopening resilience

**3. Insufficient Differentiation**
- **Risk:** Club not compelling vs. existing Vancouver/Bellingham options
- **Impact:** Weak sales, low retention
- **Mitigation:**
  - Emphasize unique assets (beach, waterfront, Point Roberts location)
  - Create signature experiences (events, member perks)
  - Build strong community and culture
  - Curate membership (quality over quantity)
  - Exceptional service and hospitality

**4. Operational Execution**
- **Risk:** Poor service, food quality, or member experience
- **Impact:** Member attrition, reputation damage, referral loss
- **Mitigation:**
  - Hire experienced club General Manager
  - Retain proven chef and core staff
  - Invest in training and culture
  - Member feedback systems
  - Continuous improvement mindset

**5. Financial Mismanagement**
- **Risk:** Overspend on improvements, insufficient reserves
- **Impact:** Cash flow crisis, can't sustain operations
- **Mitigation:**
  - Conservative budgeting
  - Phased improvements (use initiation fees)
  - Maintain 6-12 months operating reserves
  - Regular financial monitoring
  - Member dues sufficient to cover baseline operations

### Medium Risks

- Seasonal revenue concentration (summer peak)
- Competition from new club concepts
- Economic recession reducing discretionary spending
- Property maintenance needs (1959 building, waterfront exposure)
- Key staff turnover
- Regulatory changes (liquor, zoning)

### Risk Mitigation Summary

**Overall Risk Profile:** MODERATE

Club model is **lower risk than traditional restaurant** because:
- ✅ Predictable revenue (annual dues vs. daily sales)
- ✅ Lower volume = lower operating costs
- ✅ Upfront capital from initiation fees
- ✅ Curated membership = quality customers
- ✅ Flexibility to adjust offerings based on member needs

---

## Comparison: Club vs. Restaurant

### Restaurant Model (Original)

**Revenue:**
- Estimated $875K-$1.4M annually (volatile, need verification)
- Dependent on daily sales (weather, tourism, seasonality)
- Low margin (10-15% net margin typical)

**Profitability:**
- Estimated EBITDA: $150-210K
- Heavy seasonal concentration
- High operational intensity

**Capital:**
- Purchase: $1.375M
- All-in: ~$1.6M with reserves

**Time Commitment:**
- 60-80 hours/week owner involvement
- Year-round staffing and operations
- High stress (hospitality, food quality, rapid changes)

**Exit Strategy:**
- Sell to next restaurant operator (2-3× EBITDA)
- Estimated value in 5 years: $1.5-2M (modest appreciation)
- Dependent on ongoing performance

**Risk Level:** HIGH
- Restaurant failure rate: 50% in 5 years
- Cash flow intensive
- Heavy operational demands

---

### Club Model (Proposed)

## Recommendation

### Strategic Assessment

**The private club model is superior to restaurant for this property because:**

1. **Financial Performance**
   - Generates $4.4M profit over 5 years vs. $750K-$1M for restaurant
   - Higher margins and predictable revenue
   - Initiation fees fund acquisition and improvements (massive advantage)

2. **Market Opportunity**
   - No direct competition in Point Roberts
   - Vancouver affluent market is large and underserved
   - Waterfront + beach + cross-border = unique value proposition
   - Limited membership creates scarcity and exclusivity

3. **Operational Feasibility**
   - Lower risk than restaurant (predictable revenue)
   - Less operational intensity (fewer customers, higher quality)
   - Existing infrastructure supports club use
   - Resort Commercial zoning likely permits

4. **Lifestyle & Exit**
   - More manageable owner lifestyle (with experienced GM)
   - Higher exit valuation (NOI multiples)
   - Multiple exit strategies
   - Builds valuable real estate + business asset

5. **Leverages Unique Assets**
   - Beach rights (core value driver for club)
   - Waterfront location (premium amenity)
   - Rare zoning (flexibility for future)
   - Proximity to Vancouver (key market)

### Implementation Recommendation

**Phase 1: Validate Before Committing (Month 1-2)**

**Market Validation Steps:**
1. Conduct 50 interviews with potential members (Vancouver high-net-worth)
2. Survey interest and pricing acceptance
3. Host 2-3 preview events in Vancouver
4. Gauge founding member interest (target: 50+ expressions of interest)
5. Consult with club industry expert

**Legal Validation:**
1. Confirm zoning allows private club
2. Understand liquor license conversion
3. Legal structure advice (for-profit LLC recommended)

**Financial Validation:**
1. Refine projections with real market data
2. Confirm initiation fees are acceptable to market
3. Line up financing or capital partners if needed

**Decision Point:** If validation is positive (50+ serious prospects, legal feasible), proceed with acquisition with club model. If validation is weak, reconsider restaurant model or walk away.

---

**Phase 2: Execute Acquisition & Conversion (Month 3-9)**

1. Purchase property contingent on private club use approval
2. Form club entity and governance
3. Execute conversion ($400-600K improvements)
4. Hire experienced club General Manager
5. Launch founding member sales (target: 75 @ $35K)
6. Soft opening (Month 7) → Grand opening (Month 9)

---

**Phase 3: Build to Capacity (Year 2-3)**

1. Recruit regular members (175 additional)
2. Optimize operations based on member feedback
3. Expand events business
4. Consider additional improvements (cabanas, guest rooms, beach enhancements)
5. Achieve 250 members and stabilized operations

---

**Phase 4: Harvest & Exit (Year 5-7)**

1. Operate profitably ($500K+ annual NOI)
2. Build club reputation and value
3. Consider exit options:
   - Sell to members (member buyout)
   - Sell to investor (4-6× NOI = $2-3M for business + $1-1.5M for real estate)
   - Continue operating (ongoing income stream)
