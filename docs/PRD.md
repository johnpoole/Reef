# Product Requirements Document
## Point Roberts Beach & Yacht Club

**Status:** DRAFT — Pre-Acquisition  
**Author:** TBD  
**Last Updated:** February 19, 2026  
**Version:** 0.1

## 1. What Problem Are We Solving?

Affluent Vancouverites have no private waterfront club in the U.S. accessible as a day trip. The nearest private clubs — Royal Vancouver Yacht Club, Shaughnessy Golf, Vancouver Club — are all in Canada and heavily waitlisted. There is no exclusive, members-only coastal destination within 45 minutes of downtown Vancouver on the U.S. side.

**The Reef** (1334 Gulf Rd, Point Roberts, WA) represents a rare opportunity: an 8,643 sqft waterfront building with beach access, Resort Commercial zoning, an existing bar/commercial kitchen, and a motivated seller — in the only U.S. community accessible from Canada without re-entering highway infrastructure.

**If this PRD is approved:** proceed to market validation (30–45 day sprint), then make a purchase offer.  
**If not approved:** stop here, no further capital deployed.

## 2. Who Is This For?

### Primary Member Persona — "The Vancouver Professional"
- Age 40–65, household income $300K+ CAD
- Lives in West Vancouver, Shaughnessy, Kitsilano, Yaletown
- Already holds 1–2 club memberships (golf, yacht, social)
- Values exclusivity, service quality, and a unique experience
- Travels to the U.S. regularly; comfortable crossing the border
- Seeks: a place to entertain clients, relax with family, hold private events

### Secondary Persona — "The Point Roberts Property Owner"
- Owns a vacation property in Point Roberts (est. 3,000+ U.S. owners)
- Typically U.S. citizen or Canadian with U.S. real estate
- Wants a premium social hub within walking/biking distance of their property
- Price-sensitive compared to Vancouver primary market

### Tertiary Persona — "The Seattle Weekender"
- Travels 90–120 min for special destinations
- Boater or sailing enthusiast using Point Roberts as a waypoint
- Values waterfront dining and event access without overnight commitment

### Who This Is NOT For
- Local Point Roberts residents as the primary base (population ~1,300, insufficient)
- Day-trippers or walk-in dining guests
- Budget-conscious travelers
- Anyone who can't clear U.S. Customs (eliminates underage/restricted travelers)

## 3. What Are We Building?

2. **Dining Room** — members-only restaurant with ocean views (guests permitted)
3. **Bar & Lounge** — premium cocktail and wine program
4. **Event Venue** — private bookings: weddings, corporate retreats, milestone events

## 4. Membership Requirements

### 4.1 Membership Tiers

| Tier | Cap | Initiation | Annual Dues | Access |
|------|-----|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Founding Member | 75 | $25,000–$35,000 | $4,500 | Full + priority booking + lifetime rate lock |
| Full Member | 250 total | $15,000–$20,000 | $4,500–$5,500 | Full access |
| Social Member | 50 | $5,000 | $2,500 | Dining + events, limited beach |
| Corporate | 20 accounts | None | $10,000–$15,000/yr | Full, multi-user |

> **Open Question 1:** Should we cap total members at 250 or 300? Lower cap = more exclusive positioning; higher cap = faster debt payoff. This is a strategic brand decision. **Must decide before selling founding memberships.**

### 4.2 Guest Policy
- Members may bring up to 4 guests per visit
- Guest fees: $25–$50/day (beach/pool access) or included in dining minimum spend
- Non-member event rentals permitted for full facility buyouts

### 4.3 Founding Member Benefits (to lock in early commitment)
- Rate-locked dues for 10 years
- Priority reservations for events and dining
- Named recognition in the club (wall, website)
- Transferable membership (key for resale value)
- Voting rights on club governance

> **Open Question 2:** Should founding memberships be transferable/resalable? Transferability increases perceived value and makes the buy-in feel like an asset. However it adds administrative complexity. **Recommend: yes, transferable with 15% transfer fee to club.**

## 5. Facility Requirements

### 5.1 Must-Have (Day 1 — before first dues-paying members admitted)
- [ ] Commercial kitchen operational and appropriately licensed
- [ ] Liquor license transferred or new application approved (Washington State)
- [ ] Beach area defined, marked, and maintained as members-only
- [ ] Event space capacity of 100+ seated guests
- [ ] Parking: minimum 40 stalls (verify with current lot size)
- [ ] ADA compliance (review required — building is 1959)
- [ ] Reliable high-speed internet (Starlink or fiber; border area has limited ISP options)
- [ ] Security/access control (key fob or app-based entry)

### 5.2 Phase 1 Renovations (estimated $300,000–$500,000)
- Interior refresh: dining room, bar, lounge (design to match premium positioning)
- Outdoor patio upgrade: permanent pergola or pavilion, fire pits, lighting
- Beach access: path, signage, storage for beach equipment
- Branding: signage, menus, uniforms, digital presence
- ADA upgrades as required by code inspection

### 5.3 Phase 2 (contingent on membership demand — Year 2–3)
- Guest rooms / accommodation suites (if zoning permits expansion)
- Small fitness facility
- Beach pavilion / covered outdoor event space
- Expanded parking if adjacent parcel becomes available

> **Open Question 3:** The liquor store at 1405 Gulf Rd (Robert G Simpson, tenant) — is acquisition of that parcel strategic? It's 60m away, assessed at $202K, and controls the adjacent liquor license. Worth a conversation. **Flag for legal/real estate counsel.**

## 6. Revenue Requirements

### 6.1 Minimum Viable Revenue Model (Break-Even)

For the club to be financially sustainable at acquisition cost of ~$2M total-in:

| Source | Target (Year 2) |
|--------|----------------|
| Founding member initiations (75 × $30K avg) | $2,250,000 (one-time, at launch) |
| Annual dues (200 members × $4,500 avg) | $900,000/yr |
| F&B (member spend, ~40% margin) | $400,000/yr |
| Events & venue rentals | $150,000/yr |
| Guest fees & misc | $50,000/yr |
| **Total Annual (stabilized)** | **~$1,500,000/yr** |

| Operating Cost | Estimate |
|----------------|---------|
| Staffing (GM, FOH, BOH, maintenance) | $600,000–$700,000 |
| Food & beverage COGS | $200,000–$250,000 |
| Property taxes | ~$6,558/yr |
| Utilities, repairs, insurance | $80,000–$120,000 |
| Marketing & member acquisition | $50,000–$100,000 |
| G&A (legal, accounting, software) | $40,000–$60,000 |
| **Total Operating** | **~$1,000,000–$1,200,000** |
| **Net Operating Income** | **~$300,000–$500,000/yr** |

> **Hard requirement:** Founding member initiation revenue must equal or exceed total acquisition + renovation cost before opening day. Target: $2.25M from 75 founding members covers $1.375M purchase + $500K reno + $200K working capital. **This is the primary financial gate.**

### 6.2 Go / No-Go Financial Thresholds
- **GO:** 50+ founding member commitments with $5K–$10K refundable deposits secured = proceed with purchase
- **CONDITIONAL GO:** 30–49 commitments = renegotiate price or reduce renovation scope
- **NO-GO:** Fewer than 30 commitments in 45 days = walk away, return deposits

---

## 7. Legal & Regulatory Requirements

### 7.1 Must Confirm Before Offer
- [ ] **Washington State liquor license** — Is existing license in good standing? Transfer process and timeline?
- [ ] **Point Roberts / Whatcom County zoning** — "RC" (Resort Commercial) — confirm private club is a permitted use
- [ ] **Private club definition** — Washington RCW 66.24.375 governs private club liquor licenses; requires bona fide membership records
- [ ] **Cross-border marketing** — Advertising memberships to Canadian residents; confirm no FINTRAC/FATCA complications for dues collection
- [ ] **BC Securities** — If any crowdfunding or investment structure is used for acquisition, BC and WA securities laws apply

### 7.2 Must Confirm Before Opening
- [ ] Health department approval for commercial kitchen
- [ ] Building permit for renovations
- [ ] ADA compliance sign-off
- [ ] Fire code / occupancy certificate
- [ ] Club bylaws and membership agreement reviewed by WA attorney

> **Open Question 4:** What corporate structure holds the property and operates the club? Options: LLC (owner-operated), member-owned cooperative (like a true yacht club), or LLCA with membership units. **Member-owned structure increases perceived permanence and is common in successful clubs but complicates governance. Needs legal counsel.**

## 8. Competitive Requirements

The club must be clearly differentiated from these alternatives that members will compare against:

| Competitor | Initiation | Annual | Weakness We Exploit |
|------------|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| Royal Vancouver Yacht Club | $20K+ CAD | $4K+ CAD | Long waitlist, in Canada |
| Bellingham Yacht Club | ~$5K USD | ~$1.5K | Downmarket, no exclusivity |
| Semiahmoo Resort (membership) | ~$10K | ~$3K | Golf-focused, no beach club |
| Vancouver Club | $10K CAD | $3.5K CAD | Urban, no waterfront |
| Point Roberts Marina (slip owners) | Slip purchase | Slip fees | No social/dining amenity |

**Our differentiation must include:**
- Only private beach club within 45 min of Vancouver
- Only U.S. club specifically designed for Canadian/cross-border members
- Cap of 250 members (vs. 1,000+ at RVYC)
- Event venue with full buyout capability

---

## 9. Success Metrics

### Phase 0 — Validation (Days 0–45)
- [ ] 500 qualified prospects identified and contacted
- [ ] 50+ expressions of serious interest
- [ ] 25+ $5,000–$10,000 refundable deposits collected
- [ ] Pricing model confirmed (≥70% find $30K initiation / $4.5K annual "reasonable")

### Phase 1 — Launch (Months 0–6 post-purchase)
- [ ] 75 founding memberships sold (required for financial viability)
- [ ] Liquor license transferred
- [ ] Renovation complete
- [ ] First members admitted
- [ ] NPS ≥ 70 (member satisfaction) within first 6 months

### Phase 2 — Stabilization (Year 1–2)
- [ ] 150+ total active memberships
- [ ] Event calendar: minimum 24 private events/year booked
- [ ] Member retention rate ≥ 85% at first renewal
- [ ] Waitlist established (demand signal for Phase 2 expansion)

## 10. Open Questions & Decisions Required

These must be resolved before finalizing the membership offering or making a purchase offer:

| # | Question | Decision Needed By | Owner |
|---|----------|-------------------|-------|
| 1 | Total member cap: 250 or 300? | Before founding member launch | Founder |
| 2 | Transferable memberships? (recommend: yes, 15% fee) | Before contract drafting | Legal counsel |
| 3 | Corporate ownership structure (LLC vs. co-op vs. other)? | Before purchase offer | Legal counsel |
| 4 | Is the adjacent liquor store parcel (1405 Gulf Rd) worth pursuing? | Within 30 days | Real estate counsel |
| 5 | Who is the General Manager? (must hire before or at opening) | Before first member admitted | Founder |
| 6 | How do we handle Canadian dues payments? (USD vs. CAD, FX policy) | Before selling memberships | Financial counsel |
| 7 | Are border wait times a real deterrent? (need primary research) | Within validation phase | Founder |
| 8 | What is the asking price floor? (Seller paid $850K assessed — how low will they go?) | Before offer | Real estate counsel |
| 9 | Is there a Phase 2 expansion path requiring Whatcom County approvals? | Within 60 days | Zoning counsel |
| 10 | What happens to staff inherited from current operation? | Before closing | HR/legal counsel |

---

## 11. Assumptions & Risks

### Assumptions
- The property is available and seller is motivated (evidence: listed at $1.375M, assessed $850K = 62% premium suggests price flexibility exists)
- Resort Commercial zoning permits private club operations without a conditional use permit
- Liquor license is transferable (must verify)
- There is material demand from Vancouver HNW market (assumption driving entire model — must validate)
- Border crossing is a manageable friction point, not a dealbreaker
- Operating costs can be kept to $1.0–1.2M/yr with professional management

### Key Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Border wait times deter regular use | Medium | High | Survey during validation; target 20+ min threshold |
| Liquor license not transferable or revoked | Low | Critical | Legal DD before offer |
| Vancouver HNW market uninterested in Point Roberts | Medium | Critical | Validate before purchase. This is the whole risk. |
| Renovation costs exceed budget | Medium | High | Fixed-price contract, contingency reserve |
| Zoning challenge to private club classification | Low | High | Whatcom County pre-application meeting |
| Founding member shortfall (< 50 commitments) | Medium | Critical | No-go trigger at < 30. Honor all deposit refunds. |
| Owner Nicholas Kiniski won't negotiate on price | Low | Medium | Walk away if > $1.1M; current assessed value supports max $1.1M offer |
| GM hire takes too long or is wrong person | Medium | High | Start search during validation phase |

## 12. What Is NOT In This PRD

The following discussions have happened but are explicitly parked:

- ❌ Nightclub / entertainment venue — rejected (see Club Conversion Analysis)
- ❌ Cannabis lounge — rejected (border crossing renders this unworkable)
- ❌ Public restaurant continuation — rejected (margins are the problem, not the solution)
- ❌ Option to acquire Marina parcels or Golf Course — out of scope, different capital need
- ❌ New construction or teardown — not required; existing structure is sufficient for Phase 1

---

## 13. Next Steps (Before PRD Can Move to APPROVED)

1. **Review this PRD** — confirm the concept, member caps, and financial gates above
2. **Answer Open Question 3** (corporate structure) — book attorney call this week
3. **Begin validation Phase 0** — identify 3–5 Vancouver industry contacts who can provide warm introductions to HNW prospects
4. **Request liquor license status** from Washington State WSLCB
5. **Request Whatcom County pre-application meeting** to confirm RC zoning allows private club
6. **Set a 45-day validation deadline** — if 25+ deposits not secured by that date, deal is off

*This document is a living PRD and should be updated as decisions are made and validation data comes in. All financial projections are estimates based on comparable clubs and Whatcom County public records. They are not guarantees.*
