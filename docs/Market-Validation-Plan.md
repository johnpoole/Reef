## Phase 4: Commitment & Validation (Days 30-45)

**Pricing:**
- Founding Member Initiation: $35,000 (regular price: $50,000 later)
- Annual Dues (Year 1): $4,500
- Deposit to Secure: $5,000-$10,000 (refundable until closing)

- First choice on future amenity development
- Reduced guest fees (50% off for life)
- Input on final design and amenity decisions
- Guaranteed rate lock (annual dues increase capped at 3% for 5 years)
- Exclusive founders' events year-round

**The Urgency Hook:**
> "Only 75 Founding Memberships will ever be issued. This is your one opportunity to join at the foundational level. Once we reach 75, the program closes permanently and initiation fees increase to $50,000+."

**Sales Process:**

1. **Preview Event Commitment** (Same night or within 48 hours)
   - Ideal prospects commit at/immediately after event
   - Hot leads: 5-10 per event × 3 events = 15-30 hot leads

2. **Follow-Up Meetings** (For those who need more time)
   - Schedule 1-on-1 or couple meetings
   - Coffee, lunch, or dinner
   - Address specific concerns or questions
   - Close with deposit ask

3. **Property Tours** (Close after experiencing site)
   - Tour creates emotional connection
   - Close in van on way back to Vancouver
   - Make it easy to commit

**Deposit Mechanics:**
- $5,000-$10,000 refundable deposit
- Held in escrow account (trust company or attorney)
- Refund conditions: If project doesn't proceed, if zoning not approved, or if prospect changes mind before club opening (with 90-day notice)
- Converts to initiation fee upon club opening

**Legal Protection:**
- Have club attorney draft founding member agreement
- Clear terms on refunds, rights, and obligations
- Disclosure: Club concept is contingent on property acquisition and regulatory approval
- No guarantees until final development

**Goal Attainment:**
- **MINIMUM:** 15 deposits ($75K-$150K) = Proceed with confidence
- **TARGET:** 20-25 deposits ($100K-$250K) = Strong validation, reduced risk
- **STRETCH:** 30+ deposits ($150K-$300K) = Exceptional, could cover acquisition down payment

### Task 4.2: Data Analysis & Decision

**Compile All Validation Data:**

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- Focus group interest scores (avg rating, % very interested)

- Preview event attendance and engagement

- Update revenue model with validated assumptions
- Risk-adjust financial projections

**Decision Matrix:**

| Criteria | Target | Actual | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Founding Member Deposits | 15-25 | [FILL] | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| Total Committed $ | $75K-$125K | [FILL] | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| Preview Event Interest | 40%+ engaged | [FILL] | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| Survey "Very Interested" | 25%+ | [FILL] | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| Pricing Validated | 70%+ accept $35K | [FILL] | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| Zoning/Legal Feasible | No blockers | [FILL] | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| Property Tour Enthusiasm | High "wow factor" | [FILL] | ✅/⚠️/❌ |

**Decision Rules:**

**✅ GO (Proceed with Acquisition):**
- 15+ founding member deposits secured
- $75K+ in committed deposits
- Strong qualitative feedback and enthusiasm
- No legal/zoning blockers
- Financial projections still attractive after validation adjustments

**⚠️ CONDITIONAL GO (Adjust and Proceed):**
- 10-14 deposits (weaker but viable)
- Some concerns emerged but addressable
- May need to adjust pricing or concept slightly
- Increase marketing budget for member recruitment
- Proceed with elevated risk awareness

**❌ NO-GO (Do Not Acquire):**
- <10 deposits despite strong effort
- Weak interest across all metrics
- Fatal legal/zoning issues discovered
- Market doesn't value concept at projected pricing
- Walk away, lose $25-50K in validation costs (but save $2M mistake)

### Task 4.3: Final Preparation (If GO)

  - Social club and country club partnerships

**Months 7-9: Soft Opening with Regular Member Sales**

- Lower initiation ($15K vs. $35K) but still premium pricing
- Use founding member satisfaction as social proof

**Year 2-3: Build to Capacity**
- Steady regular member recruitment
- Host open houses and member guest events

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Low Interest/Attendance at Preview Events

**Mitigation:**
- **Prevention:** Over-invite (3:1 invite:attendance ratio), strong incentives
- **Response:** If first event is weak (<30 attendees), pivot messaging for events 2-3
- **Contingency:** Add more events or extend validation timeline

### Risk 2: Price Resistance ($35K Too High)

**Mitigation:**
- **Prevention:** Test pricing in focus groups and survey before events
- **Response:** Offer tiered founding memberships:
  - Tier 1: $50K (includes 5-year dues prepaid)
  - Tier 2: $35K (standard founding)
  - Tier 3: $20K (social/limited founding)
- **Contingency:** Adjust pricing model, increase member count to 300-400 to offset lower initiations

### Risk 3: Legal/Zoning Blockers

**Mitigation:**
- **Prevention:** Research legal feasibility EARLY (Week 1-2)
- **Response:** If conditional use permit needed, understand timeline and path
- **Contingency:** If club not allowed, explore:
  - Restaurant with "members-only" nights
  - Event venue focus vs. full club
  - Walk away before acquisition

### Risk 4: Border Crossing Concerns

**Mitigation:**
- **Prevention:** Address directly in presentations (NEXUS, border times, destination approach)
- **Message:** "30-minute easy border crossing, become a destination club (stay weekends)"
- **Response:** Diversify target market (Seattle, Bellingham, locals) if Vancouver resistance
- **Contingency:** Emphasize extended-stay value (future guest rooms, weekend packages)

### Risk 5: Not Enough Deposits to Hit GO Threshold

**Mitigation:**
- **Prevention:** Set realistic GO threshold (15 vs. 50), extend validation if close
- **Response:** If at 10-12 deposits, extend campaign 2-4 weeks, offer time-limited bonus
- **Contingency:** Accept CONDITIONAL GO if momentum strong but timing short
- **Safety:** Maintain NO-GO discipline if truly insufficient (<10 deposits)

## Conclusion

**Market validation is the most critical step before acquiring the property.**

**Investment:** $100K in validation  
**Timeline:** 30-45 days  
**Outcome:** High-confidence GO/NO-GO decision supported by real data

**The validation process simultaneously:**
1. Tests market demand (de-risks investment)
2. Generates founding member deposits (potential $75K-$250K)
3. Builds initial member community (recruitment already begun)
4. Refines concept and messaging (based on real feedback)
5. Confirms legal and zoning feasibility (no surprises)

**If validation succeeds:** You enter the acquisition with 15-25 founding members committed, proven demand, and $75K-$250K in deposits. Risk is dramatically reduced.

**If validation fails:** You lose $100K but avoid a $2M mistake. This is smart risk management.

**NEXT STEP:** Assemble validation team and begin Week 1 research activities. Time to test if this concept is as compelling to the market as it is on paper.
