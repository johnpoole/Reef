## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **"As-Is" Sale:** Seller explicitly states property sold as-is - expect deferred maintenance
2. **Building Age:** 1959 construction - potential for costly systems replacement
3. **Border Dependency:** 30% or more of customers likely from Vancouver - border policy risk
4. **Seasonal Revenue:** Heavy summer concentration - cash flow challenges in winter
5. **Labor Market:** Small local population - staffing challenges, seasonal workers
6. **Competition:** Could face new waterfront development or restaurant competition
7. **Liquor License:** Transfer complications or restrictions could delay operations
8. **Deferred Maintenance:** Listing emphasizes land value over building condition
9. **Economic Recession:** Restaurants highly vulnerable to economic downturns
10. **Owner-Operator Requirement:** Absentee ownership of restaurants often fails

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Thorough Inspection:** Hire specialized restaurant/commercial inspector
- **Financial Verification:** CPA review of all financial records, verify cash business
- **Reserve Fund:** Maintain $100,000+ for equipment failures, slow season
- **Owner Presence:** Plan for owner or experienced GM on-site daily
- **Marketing Diversification:** Build local customer base, don't rely solely on tourists
- **Seasonal Planning:** Develop winter programming (locals' nights, events, catering)
- **Equipment Budget:** Anticipate major equipment replacement needs
- **Insurance Package:** Commercial property, liability, liquor liability, business interruption
- **Lease Analysis:** Understand liquor store lease value and renewal risk
- **Expert Team:** Restaurant consultant review, hospitality attorney, experienced accountant

## Offer Strategy

### Recommended Approach

**Initial Offer Strategy:**

**Key Considerations:**
- Listed 15 days (relatively fresh listing)
- 976 views, 20 saves (moderate interest)
- Zestimate $1,335,800 vs. asking $1,375,000 (2.9% below list)
- Sold "as-is" (seller expects lower price for condition)
- Rare zoning and waterfront location (unique asset)
- Income-producing business (value in cash flow + land)

**Offer Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Conservative (Recommended for First Offer)**
